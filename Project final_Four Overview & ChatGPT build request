Friday, 4/18/2025 - Saturday, 4/19/2025

ChatGPT, I am giving myself a 24 hour window to initiate, work on, and complete "Project final_Four". 
From approximately 12:00pm CST on Friday, 4/18/2025, to 12:00pm CST on Saturday, 4/19/2025.

Breakdown:
It's a "Project" like the CIA or NSA develop. We're running with the "big boys". "If you ain't first, you’re last!"--Ricky Bobby
It's the "final" (absolutely no more than) "Four" (the four biggest cryptoCurrencies):
1. BTC (~$1.65T)
2. ETH (~$1.9B)
3. USDT (~$1.45B)
4. XRP (~$1.2B)

The market cap of all four is approximately $2.105T. The market cap of all crypto is approximately $2.75T. We will be liquidating $.65T. Let’s strike while the iron’s hot!

To get to The Final Four, We will be building two A.A.I.s (Automatic Artificial Intelligences), with two corresponding Projects, under the umbrella of Project final_Four:

1. Project final_Four
Project/A.A.I. Janus Key
Purpose of Janus Key: to be an automatic “ride or die” for anyone working to destabilize and ultimately destroy anything in the cryptoSocialEcosystem, besides The Final Four. 
Including, but not limited to, the following platforms:
Twitter
Reddit
Discord 
Bluesky
Substack 
Instagram
Telegram
TikTok
Youtube 
Email
Project/A.A.I. get_Princesses_Coineyz! , A.K.A. Princess	
Purpose of Princess: to be an augmentation to any trader working to destabilize and ultimately destroy all cryptoCurrencies besides The Final Four
We will be striving to build and deploy these two Projects (actually, two sophisticated scripts, easily downloaded from GitHub and run on individuals’ machines) right now, 
so that I can spread the GitHub repo love, starting now.

Let’s get to it!

ChatGPT, please create project_finalFour, in one folder, with two subfolders:
Project Janus Key 
Project Princess

Both Projects need to be fully functional, and able to launch via a single .py run command.

That’s all I need in your response. I am striving to be the least verbose I can be, and I appreciate you doing the same :-D don’t want to get lost in our conversational sauce on this one, do we?
